# odin-recipes

## The Current Project
This project will briefly demonstrate some of the recipes that is needed to prepare for a meal. This also help me to demonstrate the skills that I learn to build this website using the knowledge learned by the Odin Project Foundation Course.

## Self Reflection
It took roughly around 2 hours to complete this project, although it is not hard, doing it with a virtual machine using git commits had made me more aware of what I'm doing. I learn the basics of HTML such as headers (h1,h2,h3...), bold (Strong), List (order/unorder), Images, Hyperlinks and so on. Overall, nice little project. Hoping to continue the Odin Project.
